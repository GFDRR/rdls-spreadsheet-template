# rdls-spreadsheet-template

This repository is for maintaining the RDLS spreadsheet template, which can be used by data publishers to create metadata for the [Risk data Library Standard](https://github.com/GFDRR/rdl-standard), by converting the spreadsheet to the JSON metadata format using the the [RDLS Conversion and Validation Tool](https://github.com/GFDRR/rdls-cove).
